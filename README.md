# Skincare Recommendation System using Keyword Extraction and Cosine Similarity

Welcome to the Skincare Recommendation System using Keyword Extraction and Cosine Similarity repository! This repository contains code and guidelines for implementing a skincare product recommendation system based on keyword extraction and cosine similarity methods.

# Description
This skincare recommendation system utilizes keyword extraction technique to analyze the text descriptions of skincare products and then applies cosine similarity to measure the similarity between products. Thus, the system assists users in selecting skincare products that match their skin needs and preferences.

# User Guide
Here are the steps to use this skincare recommendation system:
1. Prerequisite Installation: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed, such as numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and others. You can install them by using the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Code Execution: Run the skincare_recommendation.py file to initiate the skincare recommendation system. You will be prompted to enter the description of the skincare product you are seeking recommendations for.
3. Recommendation Result: The system will analyze the entered product description and provide skincare product recommendations that have similarity using the cosine similarity method.

# Repository Structure
`skincare_recommendation.py`: Main code for running the skincare recommendation system.

`requirements.txt`: List of required libraries to run the code.

`stpwrd.txt`: List of stopwords used for text preprocessing.

Please note that this repository does not include the actual skincare product data files due to privacy considerations. You will need to provide your own dataset containing product descriptions and information for the system to work properly.
